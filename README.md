# Wavelet-based Signal Processing tool for time-frequency denoising and deconstruction 

The code "signal_denoising_and_deconstruction_demo.m" provides a full demo of the new signal processing tool being used to deconstruct a signal into its two noiseless non-stationary time-frequency components.

# Elimination of edge and boundary effects in computing wavelet transformation of signals using time-frequency extrapolation techniques.

The code "Boundary_effect_treatment.m" includes a demo where a new type of time-frequency extrapolation is used to eliminate the boundary effects that appear in wavelet transformation of non-stationary signals and impede their correct interpretation.
